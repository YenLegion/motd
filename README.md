Collection of my 'Message of the Day' scripts.

### Requirements

  * [figlet](http://www.figlet.org/)
  * [lolcat](https://github.com/busyloop/lolcat)


### How do I set it up?

Copy the files you want in your MOTD to `/etc/update-motd.d/`. Make sure you have the `PrintMotd`
option set to `yes` in your sshd config.
